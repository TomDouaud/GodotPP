# GodotPP

**GodotPP** is a high-performance networking GDExtension for Godot 4.x. It leverages the safety and speed of **Rust** via the **SNL (Simple Network Library)** and integrates it into a **C++** GDExtension using **Corrosion** and **CMake**.

This project features a "Superbuild" workflow designed for education, allowing students to manage the entire lifecycle—from engine setup to cross-platform packaging—directly within CMake.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
* **C++17 Compiler**: Clang (macOS), MSVC (Windows), or GCC (Linux).
* **Rust & Cargo**: Required to compile the SNL crate.
* **CMake 3.16+**: Orchestrates the build.
* **Python 3 & SCons**: Required to build the `godot-cpp` bindings.
* **Ninja**: (Recommended) Fast build generator.

### Initial Setup
Clone the repository (including submodules) and run the setup to download the Godot Engine binary:

```bash
# Configure the project
cmake -S . -B build

# Download the Godot Engine binary
cmake --build build --target setup
```
### Development Workflow

The build system handles the Rust compilation, header generation via cbindgen, and C++ linking automatically.
- Build everything: `cmake --build build`
- Launch Godot Editor: `cmake --build build --target editor`
- Run the Game: `cmake --build build --target play`

## 🛠 Project Architecture

- **SNL (Rust)**: High-level networking logic using non-blocking UDP sockets.
- **GDExtension (C++)**: Acts as the bridge, exposing Rust functions as native Godot nodes (e.g., MyNetworkNode).
- **CMake Superbuild**: Uses FetchContent to manage godot-cpp and Corrosion to manage the Rust toolchain.

## 📦 Packaging for Release
The project includes a platform-aware packaging target. It ensures the distribution directory exists and calls the Godot headless exporter.

```bash
cmake --build build --target package
```

The exported artifacts (e.g., .exe for Windows, .zip for macOS, or .x86_64 for Linux) will be located in `build/`.

## 🤖 CI/CD Automation
This repository includes a GitHub Action that automates the build for Windows and Linux. The workflow:
- Installs Rust, Python, and SCons.
- Caches and installs Godot Export Templates in the correct OS directories (%APPDATA% on Windows, ~/.local on Linux).
- Compiles the SNL library and GDExtension.
- Packages the final game as a downloadable artifact.
